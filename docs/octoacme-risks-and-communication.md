# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies. This guide works in conjunction with the Communications Lead role to ensure effective stakeholder engagement.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Work with the Communications Lead to develop and execute communication strategies
- Use the [Stakeholder Feedback Form](stakeholder-feedback-form.md) to gather structured input at milestones

For comprehensive communication planning, see the [Communication Flow Template](communication-flow-template.md).

## Communication Templates
Weekly Status Template:
- Progress this week:
- Next steps:
- Risks & blockers:
- Ask / decisions needed:

Incident Communication
- Triage summary
- Actions being taken
- Expected timeline
- Post-incident blameless retrospective scheduled

## Escalation Paths
- Team-level -> PM -> Product Lead -> Sponsor
- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call
- Project Sponsor has final decision authority on strategic issues and major scope changes
- See [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed escalation and decision rights
