# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome to OctoAcme's centralized project management documentation! This guide provides an overview of our project management approach and serves as your starting point for navigating all process-related documentation.

## Overview

At OctoAcme, we follow a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery. Our processes are designed to:

- **Deliver value incrementally** through small, testable releases
- **Maintain clear ownership** with defined roles and responsibilities
- **Make data-informed decisions** by measuring impact and iterating based on evidence
- **Foster psychological safety** by encouraging feedback and continuous learning
- **Ensure quality** through well-defined workflows and best practices

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback and learning from mistakes

### Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

## Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle from ideation to delivery:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on features
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, announce to stakeholders
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and identify continuous improvement opportunities

## Documentation Guide

Our process documentation is organized into focused guides covering each aspect of project management:

### 📋 [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)
Provides a high-level introduction to OctoAcme's project management approach, including principles, roles, key artifacts, and the project lifecycle. Start here if you're new to the team.

### 🚀 [Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)
Defines the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan. Use this when starting any new project or feature proposal.

### 📝 [Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)
Guidance on turning approved initiatives into actionable plans and backlogs. Covers kickoff meetings, backlog creation, estimation, and release planning.

### ⚙️ [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)
Day-to-day execution guidance including team rhythms, workflows, quality practices, and blocker escalation procedures. Your go-to resource during active development.

### ⚠️ [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)
Explains how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies. Includes risk register templates, stakeholder communication guidelines, and escalation paths.

### 🚢 [Release & Deployment Guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)
Standardized release procedures to reduce risk and improve observability. Covers release types, pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, and rollback procedures.

### 🔄 [Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)
Framework for capturing learnings and converting them into actionable improvements after sprints, releases, or incidents.

### 👥 [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)
Detailed definitions of roles and responsibilities for Developers, Product Managers, and Project Managers, including their goals and typical communication patterns.

## Communication Cadence

Effective communication is essential to our success:

- **Weekly sync** between PM and PdM to align on priorities and blockers
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery teams (or as agreed upon)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** to keep leadership informed
- **Ad-hoc escalations** as needed for urgent issues

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, teams maintain the following artifacts:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement and success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline and milestone mapping
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done**: Quality standards and acceptance requirements
- **Risk Register**: Tracked risks with mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for improvement

## Using These Documents

### For New Team Members
1. Start with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)
2. Review [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to understand your role
3. Familiarize yourself with the full project lifecycle documentation

### For Active Projects
- Reference the relevant phase guide (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release)
- Keep project artifacts up-to-date in your project repository
- Follow communication and escalation procedures outlined in the guides

### For Continuous Improvement
- Conduct regular [Retrospectives](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)
- Update the [Risk Register](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) weekly
- Share learnings with the broader team

## Integration with Tools

- **Project Repository**: Keep your Project Charter updated in the project repo
- **Copilot Spaces**: Add process-specific docs to `.copilot/` for context-aware assistance
- **Project Boards**: Use GitHub Projects with defined workflow columns
- **CI/CD**: Automate testing, linting, and security scanning

## Questions or Feedback?

These processes are living documents that evolve based on team feedback and learnings. If you have suggestions for improvement or questions about any process:

- Reach out to your Project Manager or Product Lead
- Submit feedback during retrospectives
- Propose updates through your normal collaboration channels
